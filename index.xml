      <description>Object detection in urban images from Google Street ViewThis project was based on the development of an algorithm of a data base formed through the extraction of images from Googles Street View along different routes. This program also allows to change some parameters to be able to collect the different objects we can found in an urban environment with different characteristics and distortions. Then, we applied a pretrained object detector and we evaluated the quality of the detection on the different groups of images.</description>

      <description>Hello! Well the first thing I introduce myself: I&amp;rsquo;m Paula, from Madrid. I studied engineering at a public university near my house and when I finally finished it, I realized that, in the meantime, I had been left with the desire to go away to study. I have always lived in the same city, in my parents&amp;rsquo; house, so I had always surrounded myself with the same people and had never had to meet new people on my own (to the degree I entered with people I already knew).</description>
