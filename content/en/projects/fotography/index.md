## Object detection in urban images from Google Street View

This project was based on the development of an algorithm of a data base formed through the extraction of images from Googles Street View along different routes. This program also allows to change some parameters to be able to collect the different objects we can found in an urban environment with different characteristics and distortions.
Then, we applied a pretrained object detector and we evaluated the quality of the detection on the different groups of images.
I did this project with the collaboration of the Video Processing and Understanding Lab.
